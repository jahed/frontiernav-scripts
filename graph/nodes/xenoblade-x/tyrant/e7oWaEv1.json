    "notes": "\"Squallo, the Sand-Mirer\" appears during the day to the north of Cliffside Camp and Aaroy Plain in Oblivia where it will shoot out of the ground once upon getting close enough for the game to load it and then it will retreat and wait below the suspiciously soft sand in the large open area between two mountains and the big arch stone bridge to the north. It will launch a surprise attack on any who wander too close to the centre of the soft sand.",
